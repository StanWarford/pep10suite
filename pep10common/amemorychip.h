/*
 * AMemoryChip represents a memory chip containing a number of bytes that is located in main memory.
 *
 * Each chip is inserted at a memory location starting at baseAddress, and represents a
 * contiguous block of memory up to baseAddress + size - 1.
 *
 * Each chip is capable of input, output, input-output, or nothing.
 * If an illegal operation is performed (e.g. writing to a ROM chip) a bad_chip_operation is thrown
 * If an out of bounds access occurs (e.g. writing to an offset of 0x80 on a
 * chip of length 0x60), a range_error is thrown.
 *
 * To access a value at an address, calculate the offset of the target address from the base address,
 * and pass this offset to the target read/write function. An example:
 *
 * Suppose a chip of length 0x1000 is inserted at 0x8000. It will span address 0x8000-0x8fff.
 * To access the value at 0x8caf, calculate the offset from the base address (0x8caf-0x8000=0x0caf),
 * and pass that offset to any desire IO function.
