/*
 * This class is responsible for assembling a single assembly language source file.
 * It takes an assembly language program's text as input, in addition to a
 * program manager which already has the default operating system installed
 *
 * If there are warnings or errors, a error log will be written to a file
 * of the same name as objName with the .extension replaced by _errLog.txt.
 *
 * If program assembly was successful (or the only warnings were trace tag issues),
 * then the object code text will be written to objFile. If objFile doesn't exist,
 * it will be created, and if it does, it will be truncated.
 *
 * If objFile doesn't exist at the end of the execution of this script, then
 * the file failed to assemble, and as such there must be an error log.
 *
 * When the assembler finishes running, or is terminated, finished() will be emitted
 * so that the application may shut down safely.
