 * This class extends the functionality of the default Pep/9Micro simulator
 * by checking that the number of cycles executed is less than maxCycles.
 * If the condition is violated, the simulation terminates,
 * an control error is raised, and the corresponding error message indicates the
 * possible presence of an endless loop.
 *
 * When using Pep9Term in a grading script, automatic termination prevents
 * a malformed program from crashing the script.
