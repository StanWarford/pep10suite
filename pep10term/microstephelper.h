/*
 * This class is responsible for executing a single microcode program using
 * the Pep/9 Micro CPU model. Since this CPU is capable of loops, a maximum
 * number of cycles should be specified.
 *
 * The microcode program must contain a valid Pep9CPU microcode program,
 * with line numbers already stripped. The microcodeProgramFile should
 * contain the file from which the program to execute was loaded.
 *
 * Optionally a preconditionsProgram may be loaded. If this value is non-empty,
 * ONLY unitpres and posts from preconditionsProgram will affect the CPU.
 * Any unit tests in microcodeProgram will be ignored,
 * If preconditionsProgram is empty, then unit tests from microcodeProgram
 * will work as expected.
 *
 * If unit tests are succesful, "success" will be written to programOutput
 *
 * When the simulation finishes running, or is terminated internally for taking too
 * long, finished() will be emitted so that the application may shut down safely.
