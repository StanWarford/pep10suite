 * This class is responsible for assembling a single microcode language source file.
 * Since there are many combinations of CPU data bus sizes and control section
 * configurations, these settings must be passed to the assembler.
 *
 * The input microcode source program must have its line numbers removed.
 * The logFileInfo will have "success" written to it if all compile check pass,
 * or if there are warnings or errors, a error log will be written to a file
 * of the same name as logFileInfo with the .extension replaced by _errLog.txt.
 *
 * When the microassembler finishes running, or is terminated, finished() will be emitted
 * so that the application may shut down safely.
