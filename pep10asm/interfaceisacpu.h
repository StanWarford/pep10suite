 * InterfaceISACPU describes the operations that may be done on a ISA level CPU.
 * When inherited in combination with the data desciption of a CPU (ACPUModel), a
 * CPU at the ISA level is described.
 *
 * In addition to implementing the methods as described, several other
 * data members must be updated.
 *
 * 1) Upon starting a non-unary instruction, the decoded operand value
 * must be pre-fetched (without modifying memory state) & decoded
 * according to the incoming instruction specifier. It must then be stored
 * in opValCache, which will cache the decoded operand for use by the UI.
 *
 * It also contains convenience methods for handling assembler breakpoints.
